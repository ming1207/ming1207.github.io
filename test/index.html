            CEO Rich Kramer travels to AP region to recognize 50 years of collaboration
          </h2>
                <p>Any 50-year relationship is worth celebrating, but recognizing two golden anniversaries in the same week is extra special.  </p>
                <p>
                    Those relationships in our Asia Pacific (AP) business were celebrated during the first week of March when CEO Rich Kramer traveled to the region to mark the occasions.
                </p>
                <P>On March 1, Kramer was joined by AP President Ryan Patterson, EMEA President Chris Delaney, AP commercial PBU leader Michael Dreyer and other company representatives in Melbourne, Australia to honor, thank and reminisce with Linfox founder Lindsay Fox for a half-century of partnership. Linfox is Australia's leading logistics company and a commercial truck tire customer for a half-century.</P>
                <p>
                    Later that week, Kramer and Patterson recognized the 50th anniversary of Goodyear Thailand.
                </p>
                <p>
                    First, in his remarks at a celebratory gathering of Goodyear and Linfox associates and retirees, Kramer said the foundation of the companies' strong bond is their people. "Think about the greatest relationships in history, whether in business, technology, or the arts. They all started with people making connections with each other," said Kramer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "As I think about Goodyear and Linfox, it starts with the connection we all feel with Lindsay Fox. How can you not be drawn to one of the world's most successful businessmen whose business card says, 'Lindsay Fox – Trucker'?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since 1968, Goodyear and Linfox have shared a unique relationship, whereby Linfox has provided the logistical fleet infrastructure to enable efficient delivery of Goodyear tires, while Goodyear provided the quality tires enabling the efficient running of Linfox's trucks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Importantly, both companies have always shared values of quality, innovation, trust and most of all, mutual respect. Both Kramer and Fox spoke about the importance of attracting and nurturing good people in their organizations.
                </p>
                <P>Coincidentally, the two companies held a similar event in 1993, celebrating 25 years together.  At that event, a vision for the future was expressed. "Hopefully in the year 2018 we can meet again to celebrate another 25 years of a successful business relationship," it said. </P>
                <P>"And here we are, 25 years later, celebrating 50 years together," Kramer added. </P>
                <P>Marking Goodyear Thailand's milestone 50th anniversary, Kramer and Goodyear's AP and ASEAN leadership team reviewed the country's business growth plan and toured the Thailand plant to see the new radial aviation tire facility which will be in operation this April.</P>
                <P>Kramer emphasized the challenges and opportunities in Thailand and encouraged the team to focus on the robust execution and continue to deliver strong results.</P>
                <P>Kramer capped his regional tour with a visit to Malaysia on March 5, for business reviews with country and regional leadership teams. </P>
                <P>Following a tour of the Malaysia plant, Kramer participated in a town hall meeting where he shared his thoughts on the company's strategy and direction as well as the industry changes that will bring growth to our business. He later met with key Goodyear distributors in Kuala Lumpur.</P>

                            Dear Asia Paciﬁc Associates,
                            <br> In January, the Asia Paciﬁc Engagement Survey was launched to collect associates’ feedback on our progress since the last full survey in 2014. We were excited to have 93% of you participate in this year’s survey! I would like to thank you for your overwhelming participation and for sharing your thoughts with us
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The survey helps us understand what we are doing well as a company and helps us identify areas to focus our improvement eﬀorts.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="right" style="width:45%">

                </div>
                <p>
                    While the results of the survey will be discussed in more detail in your local organizations, I would like to share a few key highlights from the Asia Pacific perspective:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Across the board, we experienced a significant improvement in our survey results as you are reporting in that you feel more engaged and feel more enabled to perform your job at a high level. We need to continue making progress going forward!
                </p>
                <p>
                    While we saw improvements across the organization, we were especially excited to see a significant increase in our levels of engagement with those of you working in our manufacturing organization. When we initiated our plant optimization journey, we knew it had the potential to transform the way work and now we see its potential is even greater than our expectations. We are seeing the evidence your efforts in our factories and it also shows in your passion to find a better way to work every day. Our continued efforts to ensure our safety at work also contributed to the significant improvement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this year's survey, you also reported that your engagement level is higher than the engagement level of associates from the best performing global companies and higher than associates working for other Asia Pacific organizations. You highlighted the following positives in your feedback:
                </p>
                <p>
                    - You are proud to work at Goodyear
                    <br> - You feel that your skills are well utilized in your role
                    <br> - You understand how you can impact Goodyear's success
                </p>
                <p>
                    While the overall results were very positive, I would like to highlight two of our key improvement opportunities. We will focus on these areas going forward:
                    <br> - We need to better support you by reducing the barriers to performing your job at a higher level
                    <br> - We need to continue communicating Goodyear's direction to unleash your potential to go above and beyond in your current role.
                </p>
                <p>
                    More information about the survey results and action plan will be shared with you by your business and functional leaders in the following weeks and months. Thank you again for your feedback and active participation. Your participation will help make Goodyear an even greater place to work.

            A safety message from Cesar Silva, VP manufacturing, Asia Pacific
          </h2>

                    <div class="left" style="width:62%">
                        <p>
                            Dear Asia Pacific Associates,
                            <br> As a leading global manufacturing company, Goodyear is committed to excellence in environmental, health and safety performance. We recognize that our efforts to guarantee the safety and wellness of our associates benefits everyone, including our families, friends, and co-workers. As such, we want to demonstrate the highest EHS standards in Goodyear - it is the way we work every day and is essentialfor our long-term success.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Our safety track record continues to trend favorably and reflects our shared commitment to operate in a secure environment. We are proud to have completed another "safe month" in February - without a single OSHA recordable incident in the whole region! Congratulations to the team for the fantastic news!
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="right" style="width:34%">

                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>
                    In Goodyear, we will never be satisfied with our safety performance until every employee and contractor around the world goes home injury-free every day. With good judgement and sustainable governance initiatives in every facility, more than 7,000 manufacturing associates can go home safely every day to enjoy their life with families and friends. This is a strong evidence that "ZERO incidents" is possible when we take "Safety as a value".
                </p>
                <p>
                    As part of this goal, we would like to take a moment to highlight the importance of the SIP (Serious Injury Prevention) program, which helps us identify and prioritize the incidents and hazards with the highest risk for serious injuries. As you know, the SIP program has been implemented into our existing safety systems in 2017 to improve safety standards in every Goodyear facility around the world. We are thrilled to see the excellent progress towards the integration of the program throughout Asia Pacific, but as part of our continuous effort to promote safety, additional communication and training will be provided to ensure that everyone understands the methodology and the know-hows to use it to prevent injuries.
                </p>
                <div class="mix-box clear">

                    <div class="right" style="width:67%">
                        <p>
                            Safety is an essential value in every Goodyear facility and for all of our associates: we must all remember that safety comes first, and nothing is more important.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We thank each one of you throughout Asia Pacific for the significant progress that has been realized in our safety performances. It is a result of passion and commitment at all levels of the organization. And more importantly, we are very proud of your personal leadership to drive a working environment and culture around the value of safety.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>
                    However, despite all of the achievements so far, we are still not there yet. As a region, the only acceptable number for Asia Pacific is “ZERO incidents”. To reach this goal, we need to continue demonstrating “safety as a value” through our personal leadership, together with the engaged hearts and minds of our people.</p>
                <p>
                    Let's all work as One Team to achieve "ZERO incidents", please remember that we are our own safety leader.
                </p>

            Goodyear India celebrates 120 years of innovation at Auto Expo 2018
          </h2>
                <p>
                    Goodyear India showcased its concept tyres at Auto Expo 2018, a biennial motor show, which co-incided with Goodyear's 120th Birthday. Goodyear India unveiled its innovative concept tyre "Eagle-360", a visionary tyre for future autonomous vehicles along with 'BH-03' & 'Triple Tube'. Celebrating its 120 years of innovation, Goodyear at the 14th Auto Expo showcased how it has been consistently innovating and introducing breakthrough technologies in the tire industry, and this was brought alive through a film highlighting Goodyear's key milestones.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Expo gave us an opportunity to showcase Goodyear's technical capabilities in various areas including aviation, racing, heritage & future tyres along with the line up of the current range. Goodyear's stall received exciting response & drew large number of footfalls at the gaming section, which allowed participants to experience the maneuvering capabilities of Eagle-360 tyres while playing the 'Eagle-360 parking game'. The Selfie zone at the stall, where participants could take their 'Selfie with an Astronaut', was quite a crowd puller. Photos & videos of these activities also drove engagement on social media.
                </p>
                <br>
                <img src="images/section4.png">
                <p>

                            The guests were treated to a tour of Goodyear's Innovation Center Manufacturing (ICM) facility where NASCAR and NHRA tires are made. Before the tour, Xu Su, GIC*A engineer presented an overview of Goodyear's innovation leadership and the company's global technology footprint.

                            Most impressive was a tour of the blimp base at Wingfoot Lake. The group received an up-close view of the build of Goodyear's newest airship, which to them represents Goodyear's iconic heritage in American history and pop culture.</p>

                    The group also experienced Goodyear's industry-leading brand in a variety of formats. The highlight of that experience was attending a Cleveland Cavaliers game, which was highlighted by a Chinese New Year celebration, and seeing the iconic Wingfoot logo on the jerseys of Cavs players. The guests also visited St. Vincent St. Mary High School for a tour of where star and legend of the NBA, LeBron James got his start.

                          A visit to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio, another iconic sports organization that Goodyear holds a relationship with, gave another view of Goodyear's brand reach.

                          The group from China was impressed with the story that Goodyear had to tell and left the trip inspired by Goodyear, its history and its sustained commitment to innovation.
